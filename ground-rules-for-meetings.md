# Ground rules for meetings

Examples:

* Start on time, stop on time.
* Start by stating the agenda and the objective.
* Share responsibility for the meeting’s effectiveness.
* Remind the group of its own ground rules if necessary.
* Turn off your mobile phone.
* Use your phone, tablet, laptop etc. only for legitimate meeting activities such as note-taking, presenting, facilitating, etc.
* If more than one person is wanting to speak at a time, then raise hands and wait to be called on.
* Do not interrupt when another participant is speaking. (The facilitator can interrupt as needed to support the process.)
* All focus on one conversation; if you need to have a side conversation, take it out of the room.
* We will not call on anyone twice until all those who want to have spoken once.
* There will be no review for those who are late.
* Ask for more information.
* Be brief.
* Be specific. 
* Beware assumptions, generalizations, or exaggerations. 
* Use examples when needed to explain what you mean.
* Take responsibility for bringing the discussion to where it most needs to be.
* Is there an “undiscussable” issue that’s really at the heart of things?
* Take responsibility for your own feelings and experiences. 
* What is most important in this discussion?
* Use I-statements, such as "I felt so angry when I saw that", rather than You-statements, such as "You made me so angry when you did that."
* Emotional expression is welcome.
* Avoid name-calling, stereotypes, cheap shots, or jokes at someone’s expense.
* Work toward understanding—you don’t have to agree in order to paraphrase.
* The facilitator can use short stacks (up to 3-4 people), reserving the right to add people in an order other than that in which hands were raised in order to answer direct questions, add people in who are less vocal, or follow a thread of discussion.
* The facilitator has the power to make judgment calls on process, including directing the topic to where they think it most usefully needs to go (after checking in with the group), so that the group does not spend inordinate time talking about what to talk about.
* Step up, step back.
* Speak for yourself.
* Common ownership of ideas; don’t use names unless necessary for clarity. (We are here to debate ideas, not personalities.)
* Minimize repetition.
