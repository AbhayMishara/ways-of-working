# Ground rules for meetings

Examples:

* Start on time, stop on time.

* Start by stating the agenda and the objective.

* Share responsibility for the meeting’s effectiveness.

* Remind the group of its own ground rules if necessary.

* Turn off your mobile phone.

* Use your phone, tablet, laptop etc. only for legitimate meeting activities such as note-taking, presenting, facilitating, etc.

* If more than one person is wanting to speak at a time, then raise hands and wait to be called on.

* Do not interrupt when another participant is speaking. (The facilitator can interrupt as needed to support the process.)

* All focus on one conversation; if you need to have a side conversation, take it out of the room.

* We will not call on anyone twice until all those who want to have spoken once.

* There will be no review for those who are late.

* Ask for more information.

* Be brief.

* Be specific. 

* Beware assumptions, generalizations, or exaggerations. 

* Use examples when needed to explain what you mean.

* Take responsibility for bringing the discussion to where it most needs to be.

* Is there an “undiscussable” issue that’s really at the heart of things?

* Take responsibility for your own feelings and experiences. 

* What is most important in this discussion?

* Use I-statements, such as "I felt so angry when I saw that", rather than You-statements, such as "You made me so angry when you did that."

* Emotional expression is welcome.

* Avoid name-calling, stereotypes, cheap shots, or jokes at someone’s expense.

* Work toward understanding—you don’t have to agree in order to paraphrase.

* The facilitator can use short stacks (up to 3-4 people), reserving the right to add people in an order other than that in which hands were raised in order to answer direct questions, add people in who are less vocal, or follow a thread of discussion.

* The facilitator has the power to make judgment calls on process, including directing the topic to where they think it most usefully needs to go (after checking in with the group), so that the group does not spend inordinate time talking about what to talk about.

* Step up, step back.

* Speak for yourself.

* Common ownership of ideas; don’t use names unless necessary for clarity. (We are here to debate ideas, not personalities.)

* Minimize repetition. 



## Meeting Timeline


Before a meeting:

* Invite people with enough notice.

* In the invitation, include the participants, meeting objective, desired outcome, and any preparation that you want partipants to do.


Plan a meeting:

* Is everyone clear on the objectives and outcomes?

* Is everyone clear on what their roles will be in the meeting?

* Who’s coming? What are their roles? Do they know that’s their role?

* What supplies will you need in the meeting? Do you have them?

* What activities will you do to get to the desired outcome? Not theoretically. Tactically. 

* Do we want to allot time for a retrospective? If so, with whom, when, and where?


Prepare a meeting room:

* Is the room available?

* Is the room reserved?

* Is anyone doing setup and/or teardown? If so, who and when?

* Is everything working, such as projectors, monitors, phone systems?


Start a meeting:

* State the objective: "Here's why we are here..."

* State the outcome:  "At the end of this meeting, we expect to have X. To get there we will (explain process of what we are about to do).”

* Remind everyone of the ground rules: "Here are our ground rules. Are we still agreed on them? Is there anything we would like to add, remove, or change for this meeting?"

* Remind everyone to focus: "If there is anything that does not fit with this meeting, we will defer it by writing it down then following up about it after this meeting."


Keep a meeting on track:

* Honor the meeting agreements.

* Remind others who don’t follow them, including ourselves.

* Defer anything that takes the meeting off track.

* Work your magic.


Conclude a meeting:

* Summarize what we accomplished, agreed, etc.

* Remind how the meeting fits into the broader context.

* Explain what will happen next and recap any next steps.


Follow up after a meeting:

* Take time to breathe and process.

* Communicate with the partipants to share the outcomes, action items, etc.

* Do a retrospective with the team.

* Take action on the next steps.

* Follow up on any deferred items, commitments, questions, etc.
