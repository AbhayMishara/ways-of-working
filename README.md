## What are Ways of Working?

Ways of Working are guidelines that improve teamwork and communication. Ways of Working can define a team's set of expectations for participating, collaborating, and interrelating.

Ways of Working can include many aspects. For example, ways of working can include ground rules, aspirations, team values, team norms, working agreements, and more. We describe these below. These definitions are based on work by [Esther Derby](doc/team-norms-by-esther-derby).


### Ground rules

Ground rules are statements of how people need to behave, for specific times,
places, and situations.  Example: In our meetings, everyone has the opportunity
to speak.


### Aspirations

Aspirations are statements intended to guide interactions and decision making
within the group, and also across other groups within the organization. Example:
Every challenge is an opportunity to learn.


### Team values

Team values are statements of what people hold as important. Often, teams make a
list of their values by using behavior-related nouns. Example: We value courage,
collaboration, respect.


### Team norms

Team norms are informal implicit standards of behavior that emerge over time
from the interactions of the group. Example: By observing the team, we see that
teammates are punctual.


### Working agreements

Working agreements are protocols that the group develops and agrees to follow.
The protocols aim to forge commitment and a shared approach that will help the
team meet their goal. Example: Code is complete when all tests pass.


## Ways of Working especially for specific areas


### For goodness, wellness, positivity, etc.

Be creative. Be constructive. Be collaborative.

Be prepared. Be present. Be productive.

[More…](doc/goodness/index.md)


### For collaborators, friends, partners, etc.

View the issue as “we” not “me”.

Identify what's happening from each person's perspective.

[More…](doc/collaborators/index.md)


### For discussions, forums, chats, etc.

Encourage everyone to participate fully.

Listen actively and attentively.

[More…](doc/discussions/index.md)


### For feedback, advice, coaching, etc.

Ask for feedback often.

Ensure you’re giving lots of positive feedback.

[More…](doc/feedback/index.md)


### For meetings, briefings, standups, etc.

Prepare the participants. For example "The purpose of this meeting is X because Y".

Plan the outcome. For example "At the end of this meeting we want X because Y".

[More…](doc/meetings/index.md)


### For schedules, calendars, events, etc.

Use the strengths of "maker's schedule, manager's schedule".

Ensure all stakeholders know the expectations for availability, attendance, and RSVPs.

[More…](doc/schedules/index.md)


### For signing, video calls, loud rooms, etc.

Voting: thumb up means yes, down means no, sideways means maybe. Everyone votes and the leader tallies.

Clarification: make the letter "C" hand sign. Everyone pauses and the leader figures out what's needed.

[More…](doc/signing/index.md)


### For bonding, all-hands, kick-offs, etc.

Team bonding is good and valuable because it improves communication.

Try multiple kinds of bonding events, such as all-hands, kick-offs, offsites, outings, fun events, etc.

[More…](doc/bonding/index.md)


### For orientation, onboarding, offboarding, etc.

We use a "people" document. It lists our names, contact information, roles, responsibilities, etc.

We use a "pitch" document. It summarizes the project and its progress, much like a startup pitch deck.

##############


## For mutual interactions

Mutual respect.

Mutual purpose.

Mutual consideration.

Mutual communication.

Mutual commitment.


## For teams

All ideas are valid.

All voices are heard.

Ask questions if you are confused.

Presume good-faith intentions.

Test assumptions and inferences.

Try not to distract your teammates.

Use every failure as an opportunity to learn.

Debate the issue, not the person.

Critique the ideas, not the people.

Challenge one another, and do so respectfully.

Silence does not mean agreement nor disagreement.

If you are offended by anything said during discussion, acknowledge it immediately.

Aggression or personal attacks are not ok and will be halted immediately.

Aim to understand each others' strengths and also weaknesses.


### Team communications

Team communications are radiated when events happen, so other teammates can be in the loop.

Team communications have preferred channels, such as chat, or email, or video, or forum.

Team communications have equitable ways for remote people to participate.

Teammates commit to read communications sent directly to them within 1 business day.

Team whiteboards are eraseable any time; do not write "Do not erase".

If someone is wearning headphones, do not disturb unless there is an emergency.

Each teammate gets their own credentials, such as a username, password, and security badge.

Each teammate has a crossover person that is able to handle the teammate's work in their absence.

If you have a social network page that's relevant to the team, such as LinkedIn page, then make sure it's current.

Designate an office area for louder/bigger work, and an office area for quieter/smaller work.

If you email, then use the "To" field if you need action, and the "Cc" field if you don't need action.


### Team success ideas at Google

Dependability: we get things done on time and meet expectations.

Clarity: we have clear goals and well-defined roles.

Meaning: our work has personal significance to each member.

Impact: our work is purposeful and positively impacts the greater good.

Psychological safety: everyone is safe to take risks, voice opinions, and ask questions.
