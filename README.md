## What are Ways of Working?

Ways of Working are simple guidelines that improve teamwork and communication. Ways of Working can define a team's set of expectations for participating, collaborating, and interrelating.

## For everybody

Be kind.

Be courteous.

Be candid.

Be creative. 

Be constructive. 

Be collaborative.

Be encouraging.

Be honest.

Be open-minded.

Be prepared. 

Be present. 

Be productive.

Be punctual.

Be respectful.

Be thankful.


## For mutual interactions

Mutual respect.

Mutual purpose.

Mutual consideration.

Mutual communication.

Mutual commitment.


## For teams

All ideas are valid.

All voices are heard.

Ask questions if you are confused.

Presume good-faith intentions.

Test assumptions and inferences.

Try not to distract your teammates.

Use every failure as an opportunity to learn.

Debate the issue, not the person.

Critique the ideas, not the people.

Challenge one another, and do so respectfully.

Silence does not mean agreement nor disagreement.

If you are offended by anything said during discussion, acknowledge it immediately.

Aggression or personal attacks are not ok and will be halted immediately.

Aim to understand each others' strengths and also weaknesses.


### Team communications

Team communications are radiated when events happen, so other teammates can be in the loop.

Team communications have preferred channels, such as chat, or email, or video, or forum.

Team communications have equitable ways for remote people to participate.

Teammates commit to read communications sent directly to them within 1 business day.

Team whiteboards are eraseable any time; do not write "Do not erase".

If someone is wearning headphones, do not disturb unless there is an emergency.

Each teammate gets their own credentials, such as a username, password, and security badge.

Each teammate has a crossover person that is able to handle the teammate's work in their absence.

If you have a social network page that's relevant to the team, such as LinkedIn page, then make sure it's current.

Designate an office area for louder/bigger work, and an office area for quieter/smaller work.

If you email, then use the "To" field if you need action, and the "Cc" field if you don't need action.


### Team bonding

Team bonding is good and valuable.

Team bonding that is focused on alcohol is not good, because some people can't participate, or don't want to participate.

Team bonding events may be better if the focus is on fun, not work. Some teams use a "swear jar" idea in order to lighten the mood: if someone talks about work, then they must put a dollar in the "swear jar".


### Team success ideas at Google

Dependability: we get things done on time and meet expectations.

Clarity: we have clear goals and well-defined roles.

Meaning: our work has personal significance to each member.

Impact: our work is purposeful and positively impacts the greater good.

Psychological safety: everyone is safe to take risks, voice opinions, and ask questions.


## For team documentation

We use a "people" document that lists our teammates' names, contact info, and what we're each doing.

We use a "pitch" document that we present to stakeholders about the project, progress, goals, etc.

We use a "wordbook" document that explains terminology, a.k.a. a glossary, dictionary, abbreviation guide.

We use an "onboard" document that explains how to join our team, what we do, and how we work together.

We use an "offboard" document that explains how to unjoin our team, what we do, and how we wrap up together.

We use a "responsibilities" document that explains who is responsible for what, such as a Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM) or a RACIO matrix (Responsible, Accountable, Consultable, Informable, Omittable).

We use a "canvas" document that is our Business Model Canvas.
