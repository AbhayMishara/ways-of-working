# Ground rules for technology teams

Examples:

* Time and place of meetings, such as daily scrum, standup, showcase, etc.
* Testing strategy (unit, functional, integration, performance, stress, etc…)
* Build and infrastructure plans (shared responsbilities)
* Respect estimates
* Help when needed
* How to address bugs/fires
* Team availability (phone, office hours, attendance)
* Capacity plan for sprints, iterations, deployments, etc.
* No story creep
* Code is *done* when all code tests pass, and the code is deployed to production, and the customer accepts the story.
* Set up early for demo and prepare
* Never ignore anything! (Such as bugs “solving themselves”).
* We never say “no”. We say “sure, just chuck it on the product backlog. It’ll get prioritised later.”
* Make sure everyone gets heard 
* Each sprint must have a goal
* Stay focused on the goal / top stories
* Make sure daily goals are clear (we know the steps we need to take to achieve them)
* We make decisions together
* We email documentation to everyone in the squad
* We need to show what we have done to the business people impacted, not just our product owner (when appropriate)
