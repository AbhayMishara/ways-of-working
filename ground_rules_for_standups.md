# Ground rules for standups

See [MartinFowler.com Patterns for Daily Standup Meetings](http://martinfowler.com/articles/itsNotJustStandingUp.html)

Examples to talk about with the standup participants:

* Who attends?
* What do we talk about?
* What order do we talk in?
* Where and when?
* How do we keep the energy level up?
* How do we encourage autonomy?

Structure the contributions using the following format:

* What did I accomplish yesterday?
* What will I do today?
* What obstacles are impeding my progress?
