# Ground rules for teams

Examples:

* All ideas are valid.
* All voices are heard.
* Ask questions if you are confused.
* Presume good-faith intentions.
* Test assumptions and inferences.
* Try not to distract your teammates.
* Use every failure as an opportunity to learn.
* Debate the issue, not the person.
* Critique the ideas, not the people.
* Challenge one another, and do so respectfully.
* Silence does not mean agreement nor disagreement.
* If you are offended by anything said during discussion, acknowledge it immediately.
* Aggression or personal attacks are not ok and will be halted immediately.
