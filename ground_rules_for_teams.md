# Ground rules for teams

Examples:

* All ideas are valid.
* All voices are heard.
* Ask questions if you are confused.
* Presume good-faith intentions.
* Test assumptions and inferences.
* Try not to distract your teammates.
* Use every failure as an opportunity to learn.
* Debate the issue, not the person.
* Critique the ideas, not the people.
* Challenge one another, and do so respectfully.
* Silence does not mean agreement nor disagreement.
* If you are offended by anything said during discussion, acknowledge it immediately.
* Aggression or personal attacks are not ok and will be halted immediately.

Examples for team communications:

* Team communications prefer chat over email.
* Team communications have ways for remote people to participate.
* Team communications are summarized and emitted immediately after they happen, so other teammates can be in the loop.
* If you must email your teammates, then use the "To" field if you need action, and the "Cc" field if you don't need action.
* Teammates commit to read communications that are sent directly to them, or tagged to them, within 1 business day.
* Team whiteboards are eraseable any time; do not write "Do not erase".
* If someone is wearning headphones, do not disturb unless there is an emergency.
* The team uses Gibbs' rules from the CSI TV show.
* Team bonding is  good; team bonding that is focused on alcohol is not good.
* Each teammate gets their own credentials, such as a username, password, and security badge; do not share these.
* Each teammate has a crossover person that is able to handle the teammate's work in their absence.
* If you have a social network page that's relevant to the team, such as LinkedIn page, then make sure it's current.
* If you have a team event that's not about work, use a "swear jar"; if someone talks about work, they must put a dollar in the swear jar.

Examples for team sign language:

* To agree, use thumb up.
* To disagree, use thumb down.
* To abstain, use thumb sideways.
* To clarify, use the letter "C" sign.
* To say "I can't hear", cup your hand by your ear.
* To say "speak up", cup your hand by your mouth.
* To say "time out", make the time out sign; conversation stops and the facilitator takes over.

Examples for team documentation:

* A checkmark means yes; a circle-slash means no; an "X" is not used because it is ambiguous.
* A "RAG status" means "Red, Amber, Green"; Red means Stop/Failure/Danger, Amber means Slow/Warning/Caution, Green means Go/Success/Safety.
* Dates and times are written using ISO standard sortability, such as the formats YYYY-MM-DD and HH:MM:SS.
* For times, state a timezone; for example "Let's talk at 14:00 Eastern" is the same time as 2 p.m. in New York; the timezone "Z" means Zulu time, a.k.a. UTC, GMT.

Examples for team calendars:

* Team discussion timeslots aim toward morning times, not afternoon times, because people are generally more open-minded in the morning, and also we have a goal of keeping afternoons open for focused work.
* Team discussion timeslots use the Harvard idea of 25 minutes or 50 minutes, not a half-hour or hour.
* Every workweek has at least one day that is meeting free; the default is Monday and Friday, because this works well with traveling and holidays.
* Every workweek has at least one slot for a group huddle; the default is slots on Tuesday and Thursday after standup to 9:50.
* Every workweek has at least one slot for a team retrospective; the default is a slot on Wednesday after standup to 9:50.
* Every workday has a team standup; the default time is 9 a.m.
* The workday starts at 9 a.m., not earlier; this is because some people need to coordinate with others, such as taking kids to school.
